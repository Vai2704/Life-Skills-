If I faced or witnessed of any incident like above behaviour so I would like to proceed with the following way:
* **Stay Calm and Assess the Situation:** Take a moment to collect your thoughts and avoid reacting impulsively. This helps in managing the situation better and ensures your safety.
* **Document the Incident:** Write down details such as the date, time, location, individuals involved, and specific actions or words used. If possible, save any evidence like messages, emails, or recordings that can substantiate your claim.
* **Seek Support:** Share your experience with a trusted colleague, friend, or family member to gain emotional support and advice on the next steps.
* **Report the Incident:** Inform your organizationâ€™s HR department or a supervisor about the harassment. Provide a clear and factual account of the incident along with any evidence.
* **Follow Workplace Policies:** Most organizations have an anti-harassment policy or an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). Use these channels to formally report the behavior and request an investigation. If didn't get satisfactory response then I will go for seeking leagal assitance.
